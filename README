Overview
========

tika-exifool is an (Apache Tika)[http://tika.apache.org/] external parser
which invokes the command line (ExifTool)[http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/]
and can map the output to specific Tika metadata fields.

An IPTC extractor and mapping to Tika's IPTC metadata is provided.


Requirements
============

ExifTool must be installed.  You can specify the full path to the command line in 
`tika.exiftool.properties` or `tika.exiftool.override.properties`.

The parser and embedder rely on code that has been contributed to the Apache Tika project
but at the time of this writing has not been committed.  For convenience the patched
tika-core and tika-parser jars are included in `/lib`.
